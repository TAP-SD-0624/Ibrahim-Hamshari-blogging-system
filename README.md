# ExpressTs Template

- First build the project using `npm run build` then you can do `npm start` to run.
- After the first build you can just write `npm run dev` so it will always build and run live when changing the TS code.
- You can use `npm test` to run the tests. when importing some code to test you can import it from the `dist` folder then test it normally.
- the `.placeholder` files in many folders is just there so I can add it to the git, feel free to delete it.
- Please add a `.env` file in the root directory with a `PORT` variable so that the server can run.

Feel free to leave some feedback on how can I enhance this template.
